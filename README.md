# 2D Elastic Collision Particle Simulator
All collisions are elastic and conserve kenetic energy and momentum. Particles deflect off of the walls of the screen accurately. Increasing the raddius of a particle also increases its mass (proportional to the radius squared).
## To Use: 

* Run the evolve.py file.  

* Set the n variable to the number of bodies you want to simulate.

* Set the act.h variable to the simulation step size.

* Set the screen_width, screen_height variables to your resolution. 

## Controls:
* Pressing the w/s keys (while mousing over circle) increases/decreases the circle's radius.

* Pressing the a/d keys (while mousing over circle) decreases/increases the circle's speed.

* Pressing the up arrow/down arrow keys increases/decreases all of the circles' radii.

* Pressing the left arrow/right arrow keys decreases/increases all of the circles' speeds.

* Pressing the q/e keys decreases/increases the time-step size of the simulation.
