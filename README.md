# Elastic Collision Particle Simulator
All collisions are elastic and conserve energy. Particles deflect off of the walls of the screen accurately.
## To Use: 

* Run the evolve.py file.  

* Set the n variable to the number of bodies you want to simulate.

* Set the act.h variable to the simulation step size.

* Set the screen_width, screen_height variables to your resolution. 

## Controls:
* w/s (while mousing over circle): increase/decrease circle radius.

* a/d (while mousing over circle): decrease/increase circle speed.

* up arrow/down arrow: increase/decrease all circle radii.

* left arrow/right arrow: decrease/increase all circle speeds.
